# OKBranflakes-and-Keppy-s-Steinway-Piano
A modded version of Keppy's Steinway Piano

This is a mod of Keppy's Steinway Piano made by me (OKBranflakes). Original Keppy's Steinway Piano by KaleidonKep99
It has added more reverb, and wetness to the audio samples. Kinda sound's Like Z-Doc Piano right? That's just me I think.
Anyways, now for the important stuff.
This does use SFZ format (I tried doing sf2 but it just won't work for me, or I am too dumb lol), so it does have every sample.
Mod is solely based on the bright version of KSP. Hence, why the folder in it says "Bright" because I modded the Bright preset.

Tutorial how to use SFZ soundfonts in other softwares or players:
You want to make sure you just extract to folder in whatever directory, then select the soundfont WHILE IT'S IN THE FOLDER, DO NOT TAKE THE SOUNDFONT OUT OF THE FOLDER AND TRY IT AS IT WILL NOT WORK (notifying you because I used to do this and I was mad)

That's all really, credits to KaleidonKep99 for original Keppy's Steinway Piano samples, if you want the link to that repository it is right here: https://github.com/rastating/Keppy-Steinway-Piano

You can download THIS soundfont via the "Releases" section.
Samples edited in FL Studio (https://www.image-line.com/fl-studio/)

Also I might have forgot to say, and if you use this soundfont without crediting me before I even told you, you ARE FINE, you DON'T HAVE TO CREDIT ME. But if you are hearing, please credit me by stating in your desc:
